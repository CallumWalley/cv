# Specification

## Theme file

Directory containing the following:

### `theme.yaml`

A yaml file with the following parameters:
    `env`: Jinja base enviroment. All templates (including base) must be in this directory. Can be `.`.
    `base`: Template to use.
    `include` (optional): An include directory. 

### Base Template

Must have at least one jinja file, should make use of parameters specified in cv file.
All includes should be relative to the specified `include` directory.
This should be named in `base`.
Does not have to be full path, so long as it is in `env` file name is enough.

### Includes

A directory containing all other asset required for build.
All assets will be copied to destination.
Nest assets within directory "name-of-template" to avoid includes from one template being overwritten by another.
Any `.scss` or `.sass` files will be compiled into the destination directory as correspondingly named `.css` file.

e.g.

```tree
my-theme/
├── theme.yaml
├── includes/
│   ├── img/
│   │   └── img1.png
│   └── style/
│       └── main.sass
└── templates/
    ├── main.html.jinja
    └── header.html.jinja
```
