# Theme file

Must include `theme.yaml` with the following parameters:
    `env`: Jinja enviroment. All templates must be in here.
    `base`: Template to use.
    `include`: An include directory. All assets will be copied to destination.
               Nest assets within directory "name-of-template" to avoid includes from one template being overwritten by another.
               Any `.scss` or `.sass` files will be compiled into the destination directory as correspondingly named `.css` file
