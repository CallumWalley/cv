# CV

## Idea

* JSON file should drive creation of CV.
* Tag information for multiple variations. e.g.
  * cv-design.pdf
  * cv-engineering.pdf
  * cv-computerscience.pdf
* Also generate gh-pages page.
* CI/CD
* Python / Jinja (for pdf format at least). Maybe MKdocs for gh-pages

Inspired somewhat by this

* <https://timsainburg.com/curriculum-vitae-in-python-html-jinja.html>
* JSON resume <https://jsonresume.org/>

Similar to <https://github.com/nikaro/resume-pycli>

## operation

Everythin ing 'include' will be copied into the 'docs' directory. If it is a scss file, it will be compiled int the appropriately named css file.
`render.py` will currently do a few things.
